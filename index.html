            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. </p>
            <p>Though he had
                almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical
                analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical
                problems then considered unsolvable.</p>
            <p>
                Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in
                isolation: according to Hans Eysenck: "<em>He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians
                    in
                    his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and
                    additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered</em>".
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeking mathematicians who could
                better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H.
                Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognizing Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy
                arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced
                groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "<em>defeated me completely; I had never seen anything
                    in the least like them before</em>", and some recently proven but highly advanced results.</p>

            <h3>1. Where was Srinivasa Ramanujan educated? </h3>
            <p> 
                At age 15 Srinivasa Ramanujan obtained a book containing thousands of
                theorems, which he verified and from which he developed his own ideas. In
                1903 he briefly attended the University of Madras. In 1914 he went to England to study at
                Trinity College, Cambridge, with British mathematician G.H.Hardy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. What were Srinivasa Ramanujan’s contributions? </h3>
            <p> 
                Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan made contributions to the theory of
                numbers,including pioneering discoveries of the properties of the partition function. His
                papers were published in English and European journals, and in 1918 he was elected to theRoyal
                SocietyofLondon.

            <br>
            <h3>3. What is Srinivasa Ramanujan remembered for? </h3>
            <p> 
                Srinivasa Ramanujan is remembered for his unique mathematical
                brilliance, which he had largely developed by himself. In 1920 he died at age 32, generally
                unknown to the world at large but recognized by mathematicians as a phenomenal genius, without
                peer since
                Leonhard Euler (1707–83) and Carl Jacobi (1804–51).
