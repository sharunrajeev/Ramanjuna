            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. </p>
            <p>Though he had
                almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical
                analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical
                problems then considered unsolvable.</p>
            <p>
                Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in
                isolation: according to Hans Eysenck: "<em>He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians
                    in
                    his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and
                    additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered</em>".
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeking mathematicians who could
                better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H.
                Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognizing Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy
                arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced
                groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "<em>defeated me completely; I had never seen anything
                    in
                    the least like them before</em>", and some recently proven but highly advanced results.</p>
